I would want to use a remote repository rather than a local one
when collaborating with multiple people or sharing with the 
public.

As GitHub is public, you would not want unfinished features to
go live which would happen if GitHub automatically cloned your
local repository.

A branch is used to add a new feature or bug fix in your local
repository so that the master branch maintains production 
quality code. Cloning is used to copy a repository from GitHub
to your local machine or to make another copy of a repository
on youur local machine. Forks are used to copy other peoples
repositories on GitHub into a repository of your own that you
can add your own changes to.

By having the last known state of the remote stored locally, you
can continue to work off line and when you reconnect again you 
will be able to successfully merge your changes in.

Collaborating without GitHub would be much more difficult as the
different copies would have to be manually merged together 
regularly otherwise run the risk of the files being so far out
of sync that it is impossible to merge again. This could result
in duplication of effort and would be very time consuming.

Some changes are small and so don't require their own branch.
However, a large change such as a new feature or bug fix should
have their own branch as these should only be put into the master
once they are production quality.
