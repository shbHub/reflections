When you initialise a repository the hidden file .git is 
created. This file looks after all the commit information
relating to the repository.

The staging area allows you to only add the files that make
up a logical change even though you may have made changes to
more than one file. It allows you to make full use of the 
version control system by commiting in logical chunks.

When adding files to the staging area you can use diff to
compare the changes between versions in the working directory
and the staging area and changes between the staging area and
the repository so you can make sure that you only commit the
files that are appropriate to each logical change.

If you would like to add a new experimental feature or make a 
chnage that affects the whole app such as a change in language
but don't want to rewrite the whole app you can use branches.
Create a new branch, make the change, once it works merge back
into the master at a later date.

Diagrams can help visualise the branches in your repository
and keep track of which commits can be reached on each branch.
