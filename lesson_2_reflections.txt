When you initialise a repository the hidden file .git is 
created. This file looks after all the commit information
relating to the repository.

The staging area allows you to only add the files that make
up a logical change even though you may have made changes to
more than one file. It allows you to make full use of the 
version control system by commiting in logical chunks.
